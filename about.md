# Our background

ATESA, Inc. was founded by youth from the East Coast and Midwest with the goal of promoting accessible tutoring.

ATESA's name stands for Accessible Tutoring to Encourage Student Achievement, as we truly believe that learning results from encouragement to be curious about the world and aim to make this encouragement more accessible. Utilizing the skills of accomplished high schoolers, ATESA, Inc. is aimed towards low-income or unique-abilities students who are struggling academically, but also athletically or artistically. Services are free of charge, and tutors are paid in service hours to meet the increasing demand for high-school volunteer work.

Feel free to [get in touch](/) with any questions!
